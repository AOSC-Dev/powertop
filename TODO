* have a "show me my process" page
* fix memory leaks
* find out why CPU %age and C state C0 %age don't mesh sometimes
* add device runtime PM stats for pci, spi and i2c
* deal with debugfs not being in /sys/kernel/debug
* device events/sec into the process view
* USB urbs as events/sec counter
* identify kernel threads in the process list for visual differentiation
* investigate tick_sched_timer and why it wakes up
* find if we can do more detailed reporting about tasklet(softirq)
	* deal with tasklets -- needs kernel patch
* check various tunables (see powertop 1.x) into a tunable checklist

* debug why wakeups sometimes go to all 0's
  -looks like I fixed it, keep an eye on it
* audio calibration? Need appropriate sample


done
----
* on NHM, cpu P state stats accumulate and don't reset at measurment time
* rescan for USB devices each measurement
* brightness calibration
* rfkill calibration
* wakeup calibration
* disk calibration
* in learning, find the biggest delta and only adjust that parameter, not 
  all of them as they go
* in learning, try slightly lower base power
* display device power in power top 20
* find out why CPU power and sum of components doesn't add up
* exclude xorg/etc from wakeup blame backcounting
* GPU ops in interrupt context -> do not account special ?
* try to see if we can account graphics ops done by X to the guy who woke up
  X
* don't save measurements < 5 seconds
* auto save every 10 or so measurements
* between 500 - 1000 measurements, start replacing (at random) existing ones
  with a hard cap at 1000
* network interfaces as device
* network interfaces -- packet counters as events
  from /proc/net/dev
