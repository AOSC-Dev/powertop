* if you plug in the AC during a run, the battery code is not detecting that
* move the 2 data files somewhere sane
* check various tunables (see powertop 1.x) into a tunable checklist
* pretty print estimate to only do 2 decimal places instead of 3

* inode dirty trace point
* health report (reporting mode, not interactive) needs to include devices that don't support runtime PM
* status bar at the bottom
* have a "show me my process" page
* fix memory leaks
* find out why CPU %age and C state C0 %age don't mesh sometimes
* device events/sec into the process view
* USB urbs as events/sec counter

* investigate tick_sched_timer and why it wakes up
* find if we can do more detailed reporting about tasklet(softirq)
	* deal with tasklets -- needs kernel patch

* audio calibration? Need appropriate sample

* "report" mode
* CSV-output mode

* delta mode (Tony)


done
----
* on NHM, cpu P state stats accumulate and don't reset at measurment time
* rescan for USB devices each measurement
* brightness calibration
* rfkill calibration
* wakeup calibration
* disk calibration
* in learning, find the biggest delta and only adjust that parameter, not 
  all of them as they go
* in learning, try slightly lower base power
* display device power in power top 20
* find out why CPU power and sum of components doesn't add up
* exclude xorg/etc from wakeup blame backcounting
* GPU ops in interrupt context -> do not account special ?
* try to see if we can account graphics ops done by X to the guy who woke up
  X
* don't save measurements < 5 seconds
* auto save every 10 or so measurements
* between 500 - 1000 measurements, start replacing (at random) existing ones
  with a hard cap at 1000
* network interfaces as device
* network interfaces -- packet counters as events
  from /proc/net/dev
* identify kernel threads in the process list for visual differentiation
* deal with the "no measurements" case better with default values
* add device runtime PM stats for pci, spi and i2c
* looks like events/sec keep adding up for processes
* Readable PCI names for runtime PM pci devices
* debug why wakeups sometimes go to all 0's
  -looks like I fixed it, keep an eye on it
* pretty print estimates to only show 2 significant places cleanly
* pretty print various kernel pieces
* deal with debugfs not being in /sys/kernel/debug
