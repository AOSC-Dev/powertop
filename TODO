* display device power in power top 20
* debug why wakeups sometimes go to all 0's
* audio calibration? Need appropriate sample
* fix memory leaks
* find out why CPU power and sum of components doesn't add up

done
----
* on NHM, cpu P state stats accumulate and don't reset at measurment time
* rescan for USB devices each measurement
* brightness calibration
* rfkill calibration
* wakeup calibration
* disk calibration
* in learning, find the biggest delta and only adjust that parameter, not 
  all of them as they go
* in learning, try slightly lower base power
